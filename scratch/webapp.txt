When a user types /msa, we display a clickable link that opens a management interface in a web browser.

URL Format:
    https://webapp.url/<unique id>/<confirm id>

Where:
    * unique id: A session ID provided by the web host.
    * confirm id: An ID provided by MyServer

----

Steps:
    * MyServer connects to server and starts a new session. A session id is provided by the server and a websocket is opened
    * Websocket will timeout after a period of idle time.
    * MyServer generates the confirm id and provides user the clickable URL
    * User connects to WebApp.
    * Server checks if unique id is valid. It will also check against the MyServer connection if the confirm id is valid.
    * If valid a websocket is created to the User and the WebApp will simply proxy between the two connections.
