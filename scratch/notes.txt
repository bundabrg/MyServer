MyServer - Manager
    - Runs on each node
    - [future] Has a parent manager if slave, otherwise it is a master
    - [future] Slave just passes info to parent and can itself have its own slaves that it proxies
    
    - PLugins on servers communicate with manager
    - Manager can stop/start child services using docker perhaps or maybe directly executing them
